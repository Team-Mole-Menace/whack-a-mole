## Purpose
* Moles have invaded the garden; it is your duty to exterminate as many moles as you can in 30 seconds.

## How to play
* The game starts when you enter your name and choose your options
* Click on the blue moles as they pop up.  Each successful hit gains you one point.
* Don't click on a red mole!  You'll lose a point.
* Your score and the leader board will be displayed once the time runs out

## How to run
* Clone the whole repository
* Run index.html with Live-Server or by starting it in your browser
* Leader board information stored to localStorage

### Special thanks
* Bottles (Banjo-Kazooie)
* Moleman (Thundercats)
* Diglett (Pokemon)
* Morocco Mole (The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show)
* Guacamole (for enhancing the chip-eating experience)
